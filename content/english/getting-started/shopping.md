# Shopping

Shopping as a vegan requires a little more attention than shopping as an omnivore.  

In this section we will cover the major everyday shopping scenarios.

## Food

When you first start checking labels on products in the supermarket it can seem overwhelming to check for everything, especially when it comes to E numbers and obscure ingredients. Do the best you can, but try not to overwhelm yourself.

### Vegetarian Products

It's easy to be lulled into a false sense of security by products made from vegetarian manufacturers like Quorn. But keep a watchful eye on the ingredients of these products as they commonly contain non-vegan ingredients even when you least expect!

### E Numbers

- E120 - Never vegan
- E322 - Usually vegan
- E422 - Usually vegan
- E542 - Never vegan
- E631 - Usually not vegan
- E901 - Never vegan
- E904 - Never vegan
- E471 - Usually vegan
- E920 - Check for further information

### Gotchas

- Honey
- Beer/Wine
- Bread (Regional. particularly in the UK often contains milk)
- Smoothies (Often contain yogurt)
- Chocolate (Dark chocolate is usually fine, but always check the packaging for milk!)

## Clothes

Often less thought about than food, the following products on clothes will not be vegan.

- Leather (including Suede)
- Wool
- Silk
- Fur
- Feathers

### Gotchas

It's advisable to patronise vegan shoe establishments in particular as glues used in the manufacturing process for shoes made of otherwise vegan materials will make the shoes not vegan.

## Toiletries

With all items, but particularly makeup, some research is required to determine whether animal testing was involved in the research and development stages of the product.

### Gotchas

- Bar soap is usually made with animal fat
- 'Cruelty free' does not mean it is free from animal products

## Household items

Everything from household cleansers to pillows may contain animal products, as always it's important to read the ingredients.  

### Gotchas

- Pillows often contain feathers

## Resources
