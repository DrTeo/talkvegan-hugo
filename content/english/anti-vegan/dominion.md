The right to personal choice and agency is heavily fleshed out by the philosophy of libertarian politics. In order to be applicable to everyone, one of the core components must be that your right to personal choice must not come at the expense of others' rights.

> While people can be justifiably forced to do certain things (most obviously, to refrain from violating the rights of others) they cannot be coerced to serve the overall good of society, or even their own personal good.
> - [van der Vossen, Bas, "Libertarianism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2019 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/libertarianism/)

A brief outline of what these 'rights' might look like is also provided by self-ownership:

> On [the view of self-ownership], the key libertarian starting point is that people have a very stringent (perhaps the most stringent possible) set of rights over their persons, giving them the kind of control over themselves that one might have over possessions they own. This includes (1) rights to control the use of the entity: including a liberty-right to use it as well as a claim-right that others not use it without one's consent, (2) rights to transfer these rights to others (by sale, rental, gift, or loan), (3) immunities to the non-consensual loss of these rights, [...] Thus, we consider rape wrong because it involves a body being used against the will of the person to whom it belongs, but not because thereâ€™s something inherently wrong with sexual intercourse. [...] Full-self ownership, in other words, offers protections against others doing things to us against our will.

Animal agriculture: 

1. Forcably impregnates
2. Imprisons
3. Removes children from parents
4. Takes the product of labour (milk, eggs, wool, honey, etc.)
5. Kills

All of which deny the animals in question the most basic rights to life, freedom, and bodily autonomy.

## But are animals 'people'. Do they have rights?

You'll notice that the quotes above refer to 'people', and their right to self-ownership and liberty. The idea that animals _do not have rights_ is found almost everywhere in everyday life from the law to the dinner table.
