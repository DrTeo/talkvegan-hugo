# Argument

> It's impossible to have completely vegan food. Fertilizers are derived from animal waste and bones, pesticides are used on crops to kill insects, bees are kept in hives to pollinate almonds, worms are killed by tilling fields. All food involves death.

# Rebuttal

## Quick Response

> That's completely correct, it is almost impossible to avoid being complicit in suffering with our current food chain. Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals [...]. Raising an animal from forcible impregnation to their untimely death merely to satisfy our desire for taste is not comparable to deaths we have no way of avoiding as consumers.

## Detail - Analytic

### Intention vs Accident

Ed Winters (aka Earthling Ed) hits the nail on the head with zir comparison in zir book '30 Non Vegan Excuses'.

> If someone was driving their car and they accidentally hit a dog, that would not be the same as if they purposefully drove after the dog until they ran them over.  
> - Ed Winters - 30 Non Vegan Excuses - p72

Intention matters in the morality of your actions. The unintentional deaths of earthworms when tilling, or field mice when harvesting are not _necessary_ for the production of crops, it is not the intention to kill animals when harvesting crops. It is the definitionally the intention when raising animals for slaughter.

This distinction falls down somewhat when we consider pesticides, animal-based fertilizers, and beekeeping for pollination. This is why some vegans seek out foods from [vegan farms](https://www.viva.org.uk/what-we-do/vegan-farming). Ultimately however each person's 'possible and practicable' is a line they have to draw for themselves and this may not be within the means or motivations of every vegan. It is not necessary to be perfect to be vegan.

### Moral Consistency

Trying to trip vegans up by exposing real or imagined inconsistencies is a common avenue of argument against veganism. The reality is that vegans (being human) are typically not perfect. Vegans are subject to the constraints of time, money, knowledge, and availability of resources amongst a million other factors. We quoted the definition of veganism in our quick response but it's so important it bears repeating: 

> Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals  for food, clothing or any other purpose.  
> - [The Vegan Society - Definition of Veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism)

Each person's 'possible and practicable' is a line they have to draw for themselves. It is not necessary to be perfect to be vegan. 

This is not an excuse to have a steak when there isn't a vegan option at the restaurant. Eating a boring salad is a very minor discomfort in comparison to choosing to endorse the horrors animals face in slaughterhouses. It is only that it is necessary to recognise that it is nearly impossible to without cruelty to animals or people while still participating in a 21st century society, and to forgive ourselves for the things we cannot avoid.
