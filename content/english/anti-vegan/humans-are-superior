# Argument

> ...but, humans are superior...  
>   
> We are entitled to use animals as a resource because humans are superior to animals

# Rebuttal

## Quick Response

> Superiority supposes an arbitrary line that identifies one group as deservedly superior to another. Common examples are that men are superior to women (sexism) and whites are superior to all other ethnicities (racism).  
>   
> Yes, humans are unique and distinct from other animals in our capacity for complex problem solving. However, pick any species and you will likely find an attribute that also makes them special.  
>   
> No unique set of abilities or characteristics, in itself, provides a criterion for ‘superiority’. 
For humans to claim that humans are superior because we have specific unique attributes is just another form of prejudice.  
>  
> Even if *it is the case* we are uniquely superior, morality requires we care for those less capable than ourselves; not that we treat them as a resource.

## Detail - Analytic

> A Definition of Superior (they are many and varied) : of higher rank, quality, or importance - [Merriam-Webster](http://web.archive.org/web/20190711165845/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/superior)


What most people forget (*or choose to overlook*) in using the term superior is that:  


1. we determine the ranking systems, 
2. we determine what denotes better quality, and 
3. we determine what makes one thing more important than another.

> On the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.  
> - Douglas Adams *from* Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 1979

As the next section demonstrates, the group that sets the rules and determines what denotes superiority has an inherent bias and, unsurprisingly, declares themselves to be superior. 


### Lessons from the past

Not so long ago it was declared that 'as a matter of fact' men were superior to women and that white caucasians were superior to other ethnicities. The following are a few of the reasons that were given:

> Women ought to have the vote…  
>   
> ...but, men are superior. Men use critical reasoning and logic whereas women act emotively.  
>   
> ...but, men are superior. Women lack strength and could not hold their own in the rough and tumble of politics.  
>   
> ...but, it’s against God’s will. Natural law, as stated in the Christian Bible, was clear that women are subordinate to men

Mary Wollstonecraft’s claim (now considered self-evident) that women have rights in *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman*  was ridiculed and satarised by Thomas Taylor in *A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes: if women have rights, why not animals too?* 



> Slaves ought to be freed and given equal rights....

> … but, “The white race, with oval face, straight hair and nose, to which the civilised people of Europe belong and which appear to us the most beautiful of all, is also superior to others by its genius, courage and activity”  
> - Georges Cuvier Quoted in [The French Encounter with Africans: White Response to Blacks, 1530-1880](http://web.archive.org/web/20190423031353/https://www.amazon.com/French-Encounter-Africans-Response-1530-1880/dp/0253216508).  
>   
> … but, slaves lack the ability to run their own lives and are therefore better off and happier in a system where their lives are run by (white) superiors.  
>   
> … but, whites are superior - it’s all part of God's plan...

Today, most of us would dismiss these and similar reasons as racist & sexist. Yet, despite this, remarkably similar prejudices are used to claim animals are inferior, as if the *same* reasoning is somehow now justified.

### Humans are different to other animals

That’s true. Humans have a capacity for complex problem solving that is not present in other animals. But why should a set of unique abilities or characteristics equate to superiority and give us the right to do what we like to those deemed inferior?

> Until recently it was considered our capacity for abstract thought made us unique. However, “there is growing literature indicating that animals are capable of causal reasoning and abstraction”  
> [Decision-Making From the Animal Perspective: Bridging Ecology and Subjective Cognition (2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2019.00164/full)  

Difference and uniqueness are not synonymous with superiority. 

### A Thought Experiment

Consider we discover an alien species (or more likely an intelligent species discovers us). That species has all of our abilities together with a technology far in advance of our own. They far exceed our mental capacity, can see a far greater colour spectrum and can hear sounds outside our aural range.  They can also communicate telepathically.

If humans are superior to animals because of our unique capacity for complex problem solving then these aliens, with all our abilities  plus the unique ability of telepathy must be superior to us.

- Does this mean the aliens are justified in harvesting the human species?

If you believe that we can use animals *as we choose* because we deem ourselves superior (due to unique attributes) then you must accept that the aliens would be justified in using us *as they chose* for the same reason.

If you believe the aliens would act wrongly in harvesting the human species then you need to reconsider your claim that human superiority gives us the right to use animals *as we choose*.

### Superiority - so what?

> ...to care for and about others is what being vegan is all about.

Even assuming that humans' unique abilities do *as a matter of fact* denote superiority  it’s unclear why or how this is relevant. One of the cornerstones of morality is that we care for those less capable (or more vulnerable) than ourselves, and caring for others is what being vegan is all about.
