# Animal Slaughter
The methods of animal slaughter varies throughout the world depending on local laws and religious requirements. As such we have split this section into groups on a country by country basis. 

## Slaughter & Stunning Methods

### Captive bolt
With this slaughter method a 'gun' fires a metal bolt into the brain of the animal causing it to lose consciousness. This is typically used on larger animals (e.g. cows) and is fallible due to the accuracy required and the movement of the panic stricken animals making precision difficult.

### Electrical

For medium sized animals (pigs, sheep, calves), this is performed through 'tongs' placed on either side of the animals head in order to pass a current through the brain and render them temporarily unconscious. In some cases it can also be applied to the animals heart in order to provide a lethal shock. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)

For chickens, this takes the form of an 'electric bath', where chickens are hung upside down by their legs and forced into an electrified vat of water to stun them, prior to their throats being slit by a rotating blade. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)

### Gas

Animals are lowered into a chamber of a high-CO2 mixture for up to five minutes [HSA.org.uk](https://www.hsa.org.uk/gaseous-methods/gaseous-methods) in order to ensure their death.

### Sticking

Used for larger animals, this is the process of hoisting the animal by the back legs and slicing the its neck to sever large arteries to ensure the animal dies of blood loss. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)

# United Kingdom

> Current law requires animals to be stunned before slaughter - rendering them insensible to pain until death supervenes. However, exemptions are allowed that permit non-stun slaughter for religious purposes, i.e. Muslim and Jewish communities.
