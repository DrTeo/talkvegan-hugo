> 75% of soybeans grown worldwide are fed to livestock

This statistic is variously quoted as anything from 70% to 90%.

This in turn cites 'Mark Ash, Economic Research Service, USDA, e-mail to author, May 2005'.  
Which frankly is rather staggering, as it is essentially anecdotal evidence as it is not peer reviewed, and no information is available as to the methodology or statistical sources.

> Currently, 36% of the calories produced by the world’s crops are being used for animal feed [Abstract]
>  Feed crops represent 24% of global crop production by mass. However since feed crops like maize, soybeans, and oil seed meal are dense in both calories and protein content, feed crops represent 36% of global calorie production and 53% of global plant protein production.  [p3]
> China allocated 77% of produced maize calories to animal feed. Overall, a third of produced calories in China went to animal feed, which is 42% of produced plant protein (table 2). Half of the plant protein produced in China was used for food, which represents 58% of produced calories. [p4]
> [...M]ore than half of Brazil’s soybean production is directed to animal feed. Only 16% of the plant protein produced in Brazil is directed to food, and 79% of produced protein is directed to animal feed. [p4]
> On a global basis, 74% of maize production goes to animal feed. [p4]

It's not precisely clear which of these statistics the WWF article is refering to with the "75% of soy and maize production worldwide" statement, the closest is 74% Maize production, which, while interesting, doesn't mention soy.

Unless evidence to the contrary presents itself, it appears the WWF 75% statement is valid for maize only, not soy.
