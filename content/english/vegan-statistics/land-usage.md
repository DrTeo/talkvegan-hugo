# Vegan vs Omnivore Land Usage

>Land required to feed 1 person for 1 year:  
>Vegan: 1/6th acre  
>Vegetarian: 3x as much as a vegan  
>Meat Eater: 18x as much as a vegan  
> - [Cowspiracy](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

This cites [EarhSave](http://www.earthsave.org/pdf/ofof2006.pdf) and [Eishel, Gordon, et al.]((https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full)).   
Scroll down to the section about 'Eishel, Gordon, et al.' if you want the most defensible source.

## EarthSave

> Amount of land needed to feed a pure [vegan] for a year: ⅙ acre    
> Amount of land needed to feed a meat-eater for a year: 3¼	 acres (about 20 times as much)  
> - [EarthSave](http://www.earthsave.org/pdf/ofof2006.pdf)

Their source for this statistic is 'Robbins, John. Diet for a New America, StillPoint Publishing, 1987, p. 352'.

## John Robbins' Diet for a new America

> To supply one person with a meat habit food for a year requires three and a quarter acres. To supply one lacto-ovo vegetarian with food for a year requires one-half acre. To supply one pure vegetarian requires only one-sixth of an acre. In other words, a given acreage can feed 20 times as many people eating a pure vegetarian diet-style as it could people eating the standard American diet-style [Diet for a new American p344 as PDF](https://ia802904.us.archive.org/21/items/JohnRobbinsDietForANewAmerica/John_Robbins_Diet_for_a_New_America.pdf)

## Frances Moore Lappé, Diet for a Small Planet
The 10th edition of Diet for a Small Planet is surprisingly hard to find, and we have been unable to find anyone who provides a verbatim quote of the relevant section from the book.

The 1991 edition contains the following:

> An acre of cereeals can produce _five times_ more protein than an acre devoted to meat production; legumes (beans, peas, lentils) can produce _ten times_ more; and leafy vegetables _fifteen times_ more. These figures are averages; some plants in each category produce even more. Spinach, for example, can produce up to _twenty six times_ more protein per acre than can beef.

This gets us no closer to the 1/6th acre citation however!

The 2002 edition makes few mention of acres, and we were unable to find any comparison of efficiencies to help. [Diet for a Small Planet 2002](https://archive.org/details/hopesedgenextdie00lapp/page/n13).

### Conclusion

The 18-20 times land usage statistic _specifically_ is pretty untenable to quote so simplisticly today for the following reasons:

1. Comparing "average diets" is complex due to the huge variety in what people eat globally and even within the same country.
2. Comparing meat and vegetable sources for efficiency needs to be heavily caveated with the regions the statistics were gathered from and the time period those statistics cover as these vary by region and year.
3. The source is from 1981 (so far as we can trace it, Frances' source may be even older).
4. There are much better, much more recent statistics we can draw upon.

We would suggest a much more supportable statement would be 

> Beef requires 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much for the same amount of protein.

This information is based on the other source, 'Eishel, Gordon et al.' which you can find the details of below.

### Eishel, Gordon, et al.

> Compared with the average resource intensities of [potatoes, wheat, and rice] per megacalorie, beef requires 160, 8, 11, and 19 times as much land, irrigation water, [GreenHouse Gas], and [Nitrogen Fertilizer], respectively, whereas the four nonbeef animal categories require on average 6, 0.5, 2, and 3 times as much, respectively.
> -  [Eishel, Gordon, et al. "Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Vol. 111 No. 33 June 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full)

In simple terms, the above paragraph states that beef requires 160 times as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice per 1,000 calories. The paper does _not_ make any claims regarding the overall efficiency of an 'average' vegan or vegetarian diet with the variety of plants required to make up a nutritionally complete (not to mention interesting) diet, but the numbers are pretty staggering nonetheless.

Although not stated in so many words, they also provide the same statistics per kg of protein which shows that **beef takes almost 100 times** (98.2x precisely) as much land as rice, potatoes, or wheat to provide the same amount of protein.  

This is calculated by dividing the mean beef kg protein per square metre
[Eishel Gordon Et Al Supporting Information Sheet > Dataset S1 Excel Spreadsheet > PartitioningPerProtein](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf) and dividing it by the average of rice, wheat, and potatoes' kg protein square metre numbers. You can see in the PartitioningPerCalorie sheet that this is the same calculation performed for their 160x as much land per calorie quote.

### Possible Objections

The article also goes on to address the possible objection of the numbers being 'inflated' by the cattle grazing land which is otherwise unsuitable for cultivation.

> A possible objection to the above conclusion is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.

In simple terms, even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef (36.5 times as much as potatoes)! Poatoes by comparison use 0.41 square metres per thousand calories - [Referenced Supporting Information PDF - S19](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf).
