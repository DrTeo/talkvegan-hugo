## Richard Opperlander - Comfortably Unaware, 2012

This is cited by "A Well Fed World - Why we need plant based approaches" for their statistics (independent of the Plantrician Project infographic)

> [...] on any given acre of land we can grow twelve to twenty times the amount of pounds of edible animal products [40]. We are essentially using twenty times the amount of land and crops, and hundreds of times the water, as well as polluting our waterways and air and destroying rainforests, to produce animals to kill and eat ... which is unhealthier than eating the plant products we could have produced.  
> Comfortably Unaware - Richard Opperlander - Chapter V (2012)

This in turn cites Food Revolution by John Robbins (2001), sadly without page number or direct quote.

## John Robbins - Food Revolution, 2001

The closest quote in Food Revolution we could find to that mentioned in Comfortably Unaware is the following:

> Number of people whose food energy needs can be met by the food produced on 2.5 acres of land:  
> If the land is producing cabbage: 23 people  
> If the land is producing potatoes: 22 people  
> If the land is producing rice: 19 people  
> If the land is producing corn: 17 people  
> If the land is producing wheat: 15 people  
> If the land is producing chicken: 2 people  
> If the land is producing milk: 2 people  
> If the land is producing eggs: 1 person  
> If the land is producing beef: 1 person
