> [...]  
> Research at Edinburgh University into the effects of soya milk on young male monkeys found it interfered with testosterone levels, prompting concerns over fertility and disease in grown men.

# Reality

## Edinburgh University Study

The Daily Mail article does not cite the article directly, but an earlier 

> [Dr] Fitzpatrick [(a consultant toxicologist in New Zealand)] carried out an exhaustive study of soya and its effects. "We discovered quite quickly," he recalls, "that soya contains toxins and plant oestrogens powerful enough to disrupt women's menstrual cycles in experiments. It also appeared damaging to the thyroid." James's lobbying eventually forced governments to investigate. In 2002, the British government's expert committee on the toxicity of food (CoT) published the results of its inquiry into the safety of plant oestrogens, mainly from soya proteins, in modern food. It concluded that in general the health benefits claimed for soya were not supported by clear evidence and judged that there could be risks from high levels of consumption for certain age groups.

> Professor Richard Sharpe, head of the Medical Research Council's human reproductive sciences unit at Edinburgh University, [...] has been studying the decline in male fertility in the past half-century. He recently completed studies on the effects of soya milk on young male monkeys which showed that it interferes with testosterone levels.
> "In the first three months after birth, baby boys have a neonatal testosterone rise. The testes are very, very active in hormone production at this point and there is a lot of cell activity going on that will determine sperm count in adults and will affect the developing prostate. If you introduce a phyto-oestrogen, which can, in large amounts, alter these changes, you may predispose children to later disease. Soya formula milk is a [recent] western invention. There is not the historical evidence to show it is safe."

## Phytoestrogens and Health - Committee on Toxicity - 2003

> Given the level of complexity the Working Group considered it inappropriate to evaluate the public health implications of phytoestrogens to the population as a whole or communicate the implications in a single statement.  
> The Working Group considered that the findings from these studies do not provide definitive evidence that phytoestrogens present in soy-based infant formulae can adversely affect the health of infants. However, the findings, together with those from studies on the mechanism of action and biological activity of phytoestrogens reviewed in this Report, provide evidence of potential risks. For this reason, the Working Group expressed concern about the use of soy-based infant formulae.
> The Working Group identified individuals with hypothyroidism as a subgroup of potential concern. Consumption of phytoestrogen supplements, or a soy-rich diet, may provide sufficient concentrations of phytoestrogens to interfere with thyroxine replacement therapy. Although no adverse effects in hypothyroid children or adults have been reported in the published literature, the Working Group recognised that research had not addressed this issue specifically. In view of the increasing availability of phytoestrogen-rich food and supplements in the UK, the Working Group recommends that research is conducted to monitor the plasma thyroxine levels of children and adults with hypothyroidism who consume large quantities of dietary phytoestrogens.  
> [...]  
>  The Working Group considered that it was of more value to identify and characterise health implications in specific population groups rather than provide an overall evaluation for the general population. At present, there are only limited data on the intake of phytoestrogens by specific population groups in the UK. However, those consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may ingest larger amounts of soy, an assumption supported by what intake data are available. The Working Group has identified a number of population subgroups that may be expected to have a higher than average intake of phytoestrogens:  
> * Vegetarians and vegans (isoflavones and lignans).  
> * Particular ethnic groups e.g. Japanese and Chinese (isoflavones).  
> * Consumers of soy-based foods (isoflavones).  
> * Consumers of phytoestrogen-containing dietary supplements (mostly isoflavones).  
> [...]  
> The Working Group considered an epidemiological study that suggested an association between high levels of consumption of soy-based foods and decreased cognitive function in a group of JapaneseAmerican men and women. The Working Group concluded that this report did not provide sufficient evidence to confirm this association as the report lacked sufficient detail and the associations may have resulted from inaccuracies in the methods employed.

## The Independent - The truth about what soya does to men's bodies - 2018

> [R]esearch has linked regular consumption of soya in men to lower concentrations of sperm.  
> One [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20171107234742/https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/23/11/2584/2913898) carried out by the Harvard School of Public Health in 2008 found that this was true for men who ate an average of half a serving of soya foods a day, with the effect being particularly prevalent in participants who were overweight and obese.  
> Meanwhile, another [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20110305114701/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21353476) from 2011 examined the effects of soya on one 19-year-old man who consumed large quantities of soya as part of a vegan diet. After careful analysis, his soya consumption was linked to erectile dysfunction and hyposexuality. His testosterone levels also dropped drastically.
> [...]
> [W]hen it comes to looking at research touting the benefits of soya, it’s worth noting that these are often conducted by companies and individuals whose best interest is to promote the health benefits of soya and therefore they may not be entirely unbiased datasets.  
> For example, one 2010 cross-reference [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20131019142920/https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(10)00368-7/fulltext) claimed that soya foods “do not have feminising effects on men” as some speculate.  
> However, this research was led by Dr Mark Messina, executive director of the Soy Nutrition Institute and the author of a book entitled The Simple Soybean and Your Health.  
> Messina also co-authored a [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20121002081512/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028209009662) that same year which concluded that neither soya protein nor isoflavones had any effect on male reproductive hormones.
