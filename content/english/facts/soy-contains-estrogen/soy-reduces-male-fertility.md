## Edinburgh University Study

The Daily Mail article does not cite the article directly, but an earlier 

> [Dr] Fitzpatrick [(a consultant toxicologist in New Zealand)] carried out an exhaustive study of soya and its effects. "We discovered quite quickly," he recalls, "that soya contains toxins and plant oestrogens powerful enough to disrupt women's menstrual cycles in experiments. It also appeared damaging to the thyroid." James's lobbying eventually forced governments to investigate. In 2002, the British government's expert committee on the toxicity of food (CoT) published the results of its inquiry into the safety of plant oestrogens, mainly from soya proteins, in modern food. It concluded that in general the health benefits claimed for soya were not supported by clear evidence and judged that there could be risks from high levels of consumption for certain age groups.  
> [...]
> Professor Richard Sharpe, head of the Medical Research Council's human reproductive sciences unit at Edinburgh University, [...] has been studying the decline in male fertility in the past half-century. He recently completed studies on the effects of soya milk on young male monkeys which showed that it interferes with testosterone levels.
> "In the first three months after birth, baby boys have a neonatal testosterone rise. The testes are very, very active in hormone production at this point and there is a lot of cell activity going on that will determine sperm count in adults and will affect the developing prostate. If you introduce a phyto-oestrogen, which can, in large amounts, alter these changes, you may predispose children to later disease. Soya formula milk is a [recent] western invention. There is not the historical evidence to show it is safe."

## Phytoestrogens and Health - Committee on Toxicity - 2003

> Given the level of complexity the Working Group considered it inappropriate to evaluate the public health implications of phytoestrogens to the population as a whole or communicate the implications in a single statement.  
> The Working Group considered that the findings from these studies do not provide definitive evidence that phytoestrogens present in soy-based infant formulae can adversely affect the health of infants. However, the findings, together with those from studies on the mechanism of action and biological activity of phytoestrogens reviewed in this Report, provide evidence of potential risks. For this reason, the Working Group expressed concern about the use of soy-based infant formulae.
> The Working Group identified individuals with hypothyroidism as a subgroup of potential concern. Consumption of phytoestrogen supplements, or a soy-rich diet, may provide sufficient concentrations of phytoestrogens to interfere with thyroxine replacement therapy. Although no adverse effects in hypothyroid children or adults have been reported in the published literature, the Working Group recognised that research had not addressed this issue specifically. In view of the increasing availability of phytoestrogen-rich food and supplements in the UK, the Working Group recommends that research is conducted to monitor the plasma thyroxine levels of children and adults with hypothyroidism who consume large quantities of dietary phytoestrogens.  
> [...]  
>  The Working Group considered that it was of more value to identify and characterise health implications in specific population groups rather than provide an overall evaluation for the general population. At present, there are only limited data on the intake of phytoestrogens by specific population groups in the UK. However, those consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may ingest larger amounts of soy, an assumption supported by what intake data are available. The Working Group has identified a number of population subgroups that may be expected to have a higher than average intake of phytoestrogens:  
> * Vegetarians and vegans (isoflavones and lignans).  
> * Particular ethnic groups e.g. Japanese and Chinese (isoflavones).  
> * Consumers of soy-based foods (isoflavones).  
> * Consumers of phytoestrogen-containing dietary supplements (mostly isoflavones).  
> [...]  
> The Working Group considered an epidemiological study that suggested an association between high levels of consumption of soy-based foods and decreased cognitive function in a group of JapaneseAmerican men and women. The Working Group concluded that this report did not provide sufficient evidence to confirm this association as the report lacked sufficient detail and the associations may have resulted from inaccuracies in the methods employed.

## The Independent - The truth about what soya does to men's bodies - 2018

> [R]esearch has linked regular consumption of soya in men to lower concentrations of sperm.  
> One [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20171107234742/https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/23/11/2584/2913898) carried out by the Harvard School of Public Health in 2008 found that this was true for men who ate an average of half a serving of soya foods a day, with the effect being particularly prevalent in participants who were overweight and obese.  
> Meanwhile, another [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20110305114701/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21353476) from 2011 examined the effects of soya on one 19-year-old man who consumed large quantities of soya as part of a vegan diet. After careful analysis, his soya consumption was linked to erectile dysfunction and hyposexuality. His testosterone levels also dropped drastically.
> [...]
> [W]hen it comes to looking at research touting the benefits of soya, it’s worth noting that these are often conducted by companies and individuals whose best interest is to promote the health benefits of soya and therefore they may not be entirely unbiased datasets.  
> For example, one 2010 cross-reference [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20131019142920/https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(10)00368-7/fulltext) claimed that soya foods “do not have feminising effects on men” as some speculate.  
> However, this research was led by Dr Mark Messina, executive director of the Soy Nutrition Institute and the author of a book entitled The Simple Soybean and Your Health.  
> Messina also co-authored a [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20121002081512/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028209009662) that same year which concluded that neither soya protein nor isoflavones had any effect on male reproductive hormones.

## Soy food and isoflavone intake in relation to semen quality parameters among men from an infertility clinic - 2008

### Sample

> Of the 598 men enrolled in the main study, 140 provided information about their intake of soy foods, corresponding to all men enrolled since the introduction of the soy food intake questionnaire into the study. Among these 140 men, 40 men were excluded from the statistical analysis because they did not provide a semen sample. One azoospermic man was also excluded to prevent undue influence from extreme sperm counts and because the mechanism responsible for azoospermia may be related to obstructive or genetic causes rather than environmental influences. This left 99 men with complete dietary and semen analysis data available for analyses. These men were divided into four groups according to their soy food and isoflavone intake. The reference group included men without any intake of soy or each of the isoflavones examined.  
> Men were primarily Caucasian (90%) with a mean (SD) age of 36.4 (5.0) years. The majority of men were overweight or obese (72%) defined as a BMI ≥25 kg/m2.

### Conclusion

> [W]e found an inverse association between consumption of soy foods and sperm concentration which was more pronounced at the higher end of the sperm concentration distribution and among overweight or obese men. The clinical significance of these findings remains to be determined. Owing to the scarcity of human data in this area, it is very important that this issue is examined further, ideally in randomized trials.

### NHS Response

> This small cross-sectional study suggests a link between soy and sperm quality. The idea that soy affects male fertility is not new, and there is a growing body of research on it. However, so far there is little consensus from the studies as to the true relationship here.  
> [...]  
> There are contradictory results from studies in this area (both human and animal studies), including the argument that the Asian diet (high in phytoestrogens from soy foods) has no apparent effect on fertility. Others support the view that soy has a positive or null effect on sperm quality. As the researchers state, this lack of consistency – particularly between animal and human studies – "highlights the importance of conducting further studies in humans".

## Clinical studies show no effects of soy protein or isoflavones on reproductive hormones in men: results of a meta-analysis - August 2010

### Limitations
> The quality of studies included in a meta-analysis largely determines the utility of the findings. Only 15 studies were placebo controlled and included baseline and ending analyte concentrations, yet results were consistent with all clinical studies conducted to date. In all, most studies were shortterm, with an average study duration of about 74 days. In addition, several studies measured T without also assessing SHBG concentrations. The major limitation of these findings is that most of the studies were designed for primary endpoints other than bioavailable T assessment.

### Conclusion
> The results of this meta-analysis indicate that neither soy protein nor isoflavones affect reproductive hormone concentrations in men regardless of age or cancer status. Although the duration of most trials was <6 months, soy protein and isoflavone intake greatly exceeded typical dietary Japanese intake (2). These results suggest that consumption of soy foods or isoflavone supplements would not result in the adverse effects associated with lower T levels (31–33). Conversely, these data also suggest that lowering either free T or T is not a likely mechanism for the proposed role of soy in reducing prostate cancer risk.
