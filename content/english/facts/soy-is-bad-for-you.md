# Popular Fact

> Soy's phytoestrogens cause a variety of negative health effects including reducing male fertility.

See our article: [Soy contains estrogen]({{<ref "/facts/soy-contains-estrogen">}}) for more information on phytoestrogens.

# Reality

> 1. Soy contains phytoestrogens which are structurally similar to human estrogen (specifically *isoflavones*) which may or may not have negative effects in high dosages (see *[Soy contains estrogen]({{<ref "/facts/soy-contains-estrogen">}})*).  
> 2. An average vegetarian isoflavone ingestion is "7-12mg per day" (see *Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018* below).  
> 4. "[T]o have the *beneficial* effects of soy isoflavones, intake should be at least of 60-100 mg per day" see *Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018* below)
> 5. Speculation: It is reasonable to assume a similar dosage is required to see any negative effects.  
> 6. It is _unlikely_ that you will ingest a high enough dosage to affect your health as part of a balanced diet provided you do not have any special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) (see *Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018* below).  
> 7. All articles on the topic caveat their conclusions with: 'more research is needed'.  
> 8. Ensure that you vary your protein sources and consult your dietitian for special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) see *Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018* below.

> \- TalkVeganToMe's layman's understanding from surveying the material available online

Because of the complexity of this topic (and lack of definite declarations of safety from major organisations and articles not associated with the soy industry) we have opted to quote some of the most common sources presenting evidence for and against the risks of soy. This does not follow our normal pattern of debunking but does allow you to be well informed on the topic and arrive at your own conclusions.

# Studies

There is an *huge* amount of information available on the safety of soy, more than 2000 soy-related peer-reviewed articles are published annually [Soy and Health Update - Nutrients 2016](http://web.archive.org/web/20190923193109/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5188409/).   
Those which point to negative health effects of soy usually have extremely small sample sizes, and extremely high dosages (see *Showing Risk* below).   
Those which suggest that there is no evidence of negative outcomes caveat these conclusions with the "a [lack] of long term data on soy consumption in Western countries". 

We have summarised each below and (where possible linked to the original complete articles) for your convenience.

## Suggesting Risk/Impact 

### Cancer

#### Dietary Soy and Increased Risk of Bladder Cancer - 2002
> The association between soyfood consumption and subsequent bladdercancer risk was investigated in a population-based cohort study, the Singapore Chinese Health Study. As of December 31, 2000, 329,848 person-years of follow-up were accrued. Sixty-one histologically confirmed incident bladder cancer cases were identified. Information on soyfood consumption at baseline was obtained through in-person interviews using a validated dietary questionnaire. [...]  
> High intake of soyfood was statistically significantly related to an elevated risk of bladder cancer.

#### Effects of soy-protein supplementation on epithelial proliferation in the histologically normal human breast - 1998
> Short-term dietary soy stimulates breast proliferation; further studies are required to determine whether this is due to estrogen agonist activity and to examine the long-term effects of soy supplementation on the pituitary gland and breast.

#### Stimulatory Influence of Soy Protein Isolate on Breast Secretion in Pre- and Postmenopausal Women - 1996

> Instead, this pilot study indicates that prolonged consumption of soy protein isolate has a stimulatory effect on the premenopausal female breast, characterized by increased secretion of breast fluid, the appearance of hyperplastic epithelial cells, and elevated levels of plasma estradiol. These findings are suggestive of an estrogenic stimulus from the isoflavones genistein and daidzein contained in soy protein isolate.

### Male Fertility

#### Hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction associated with soy product consumption - 2011
> We present the case of a 19-y-old type 1 diabetic but otherwise healthy man with sudden onset of loss of libido and erectile dysfunction after the ingestion of large quantities of soy-based products in a vegan-style diet. Blood levels of free and total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were taken at the initial presentation for examination and continuously monitored up to 2 y after discontinuation of the vegan diet. Blood concentrations of free and total testosterone were initially decreased, whereas DHEA was increased. These parameters normalized within 1 y after cessation of the vegan diet.

**Note:** This is a study of a single person which has not been replicated in any other study we have seen.

#### An unusual case of gynecomastia associated with soy product consumption - 2008
>  A 60-year-old man was referred to the endocrinology clinic [...]. He reported erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.[...] Because of the normal findings from the imaging evaluation, the patient was interviewed again, and he described a daily intake of 3 quarts of soy milk. After he discontinued drinking soy milk, his breast tenderness resolved and his estradiol concentration slowly returned to normal.

**Note:** This is a study of a single person which has not been replicated in any other study we have seen.

## Suggest Absence of Risk or Absence of Conclusive Data

### Breast Cancer
> The available human studies do not indicate that an isoflavone exposure as reported in the thoroughly studied Asian population or as investigated in clinical studies (i.e., about 100 mg/day) negatively influences breast cancer risk or the thyroid hormone system in healthy women. However, the SKLM points out that particular attention should be given to the susceptible risk groups. These include people with an iodine deficiency4 (especially during pregnancy), (subclinical) hypothyroidism, and/or (congenital) thyroid dysfunction as well as women with breast cancer or with a history of breast cancer.  
> [...]  
> There is a need for further scientific research to be able to perform a conclusive risk assessment on the impact of isoflavones on breast tissue and the thyroid hormone system.   
> - [Effects of isoflavones on breast tissue and the thyroid hormone system in humans: a comprehensive safety evaluation - 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002184041/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-018-2279-8)

### Male Fertility

#### Soy protein isolates of varying isoflavone content do not adversely affect semen quality in healthy young men - 2010
> In summary, this study demonstrated that 8 weeks' consumption of SPI of low or high isoflavone content did not significantly affect semen quality parameters in a sample of 32 healthy adult males. Future studies should be of longer duration to better account for the time required for spermatogenesis and thus more accurately reflect the effect of soy isoflavones on semen quality and reproductive health in adult men.

### Infant Formula

#### The health implications of soy infant formula - 2009
>  [A]lthough [Soy Formula] differed significantly from [Breast Milk], [Milk Forumla] also differed from [Breast Milk], and [Soy Formula] differed from [Milk Forumla]. Nonetheless, these animals grew and developed normally, and [Soy Formula] piglets had several health benefits (eg, increased bone quality) and no observable adverse effects. Thus, to date, our results suggest that [Soy Formula] supports normal growth and may have advantages in promoting bone development.
- [The health implications of soy infant formula. - 2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002185232/https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/89/5/1668S/4596959)

**Note:** This is a study of the effect of soy infant formula on pigs, not on humans.


#### US National Toxicology Program Monograph on Soy Infant Formula - 2010
> The NTP concurs with the conclusion of the CERHR Expert Panel on Soy Infant Formula that
there is minimal concern for adverse effects on development in infants who consume soy
infant formula.
> This level of concern represents a “2” on the five-level scale of concern used by the NTP.
> [...] The existing epidemiological literature on soy infant formula exposure is insufficient to reach a conclusion on whether soy infant formula does or does not cause adverse effects on development in humans. There is “clear evidence” for adverse effects of genistein [(the primary isoflavone in soy infant formula)] on reproductive development and function in female rats and mice manifested as accelerated puberty [...], abnormal estrous cyclicity, cellular changes to the female reproductive tract, and decreased fecundity (i.e., decreased fertility, implants, and litter size). Also, Infants fed soy infant formula can have blood levels of total genistein that exceed those measured in neonatal or weanling rodents following treatment with genistein at dose levels that induced adverse effects in the animals.  
> However, the NTP accepts the conclusions of the expert panel that the current literature in laboratory animals is limited in its utility for reaching conclusions for infants fed soy infant formula. The NTP agrees with the expert panel that the individual isoflavone studies [...] in laboratory animals would benefit from data on the effects of mixtures of isoflavones and/or other components present in soy infant formula because these mixture studies would better replicate human infant exposures.

#### Exposure to Soy-Based Formula in Infancy and Endocrinological and Reproductive Outcomes in Young Adulthood - 2001
> No statistically significant differences were observed between groups in either women or men for more than 30 outcomes. However, women who had been fed soy formula reported slightly longer duration of menstrual bleeding [...], with no difference in severity of menstrual flow. They also reported greater discomfort with menstruation (unadjusted relative risk for extreme discomfort vs no or mild pain[...]).

### Overall

#### Soy Isoflavones: A Safety Review - 2003

>  Whereas results in some studies are limited or conflicting, when viewed in its entirety, the current literature supports the safety of isoflavones as typically consumed in diets based on soy or containing soy products.  
> - [Soy Isoflavones: A Safety Review - 2003](http://web.archive.org/web/20191002184755/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Melody_Harwood2/publication/10855804_Soy_Isoflavones_A_Safety_Review/links/5bd721a8a6fdcc3a8dae5fec/Soy-Isoflavones-A-Safety-Review.pdf?origin=publication_detail)

#### Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018

This article became one of our primary sources due to its recency and broad coverage of other articles.

##### Average Vegetarian Intake

> Vegetarians had the major intake among the Western people, with 7-12 mg per day of total isoflavones.   
> - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p3](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)

##### Required Active Dosage
> Overall, the low content of bioactive compounds in second generation soy foods [(e.g. soy based mock meats)] and moderate amounts in traditional soy preparations offer modest health benefits with very limited risk for potential adverse health effects. At the same time, to have the beneficial effects of soy isoflavones, intake should be at least of 60-100 mg per day, at present not easily reached in Western countries.  
> - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p21](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)

##### On extrapolation from data
> Despite the high intakes in Asian countries, there is still a paucity of long term data on soy consumption in Western countries. Currently, the use of soy foods in infancy, including soy-based infant formulas, was not linked to adverse events. However, absence of evidence is not an evidence of absence.
> - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p22](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)

##### On methodology
> The transfer of data from in vitro and animal model to human health, as well as clinical trial results with isolate or concentrate fractions from soy, as well diverse nutraceuticals supplements, must be carefully interpreted. The disturbing effect of soy on thyroid hormones in subclinical hypothyroidism has been debated but it seems to be a mere goitrogenic [(interfering with iodine absorption)] mechanism, so it is crucial to satisfy adequate intakes of iodine from foods or by fortification, especially in vegetarians.  
> - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018  - p22](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)

##### Conclusion and recommendation
> The use of various protein sources could be useful for avoiding a monochromatic nutrition in vegetarians, widely based on soy. Key nutrients in soy (such as proteins, minerals, vitamins and phytochemicals) are also shared by others plant foods, so it is unnecessary in vegetarian diet to always choose soy and soy foods. Seeds, nuts, cereals and other pulses can be good sources of protein that can be alternatively chosen to obtain a nutritionally adequate and healthy diet, as proposed in VegPlate method and the use of soy can be limited to personal taste and habits.

#### The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017

> Tempfer et al. (2009) reported a meta‐analysis on possible side effects of phytoestrogens. Based on 174 randomized controlled trials, it was concluded that phytoestrogen supplements have a safe side effect profile with moderately elevated rates of gastrointestinal side effects. It is important to note, however, that these studies were generally not designed to study the safety of the phytoestrogens.  
> [...]  
> [I]t can be concluded that several potential health benefits of phytoestrogens have been reported but that, given the data on potential adverse health effects, the current evidence on these beneficial health effects is not so obvious that they clearly outweigh the possible health risks. This implies that a definite conclusion on possible beneficial health effects of phytoestrogens cannot be made.
> - [The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20190830183448/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bph.13622)

This study does not put a specific weight to the risks in question, focussing more heavily as it does on the research into the potential benefits. It simply acknowledges that because "the health benefits or risks of isoflavones and other phytoestrogens are still controversial" making recommendations to consume additional soy products on the basis of the supposed benefits is not warranted.

#### Pros and cons of phytoestrogens - Front Neuroendocrinol - 2010

> Infants fed soy formula have the highest exposure to any nonpharmacological source of estrogen-like compounds, yet we know virtually nothing about how the use of these phytoestrogen-rich formulas might impact their future reproductive health.  
> [...]   
> Consumers should be aware that soy contains endocrine disrupting compounds and make dietary choices accordingly. For a typical consumer, alarm over soy products is likely unnecessary but so is the belief that a soy-rich diet will alleviate all ills. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or attempting to become pregnant should use soy foods with caution and be aware that soy formula may not be the best option for their babies. Older individuals, especially those with high cholesterol, may experience modest benefits including improved bone and cardiovascular health, and perhaps a decreased risk of carcinogenesis.

#### Effect of soy on health outcomes - Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality - 2005

>  The evidence from human studies does not suggest any worrisome adverse events beyond mild gastrointestinal intolerance. Conclusions were often limited due to small numbers of studies or heterogeneity across studies. Given the large amount of heterogeneity and inadequate reporting, particularly related to soy protein and isoflavone dose, many questions remain as to whether specific soy products in adequate doses may be of benefit in specific populations. Further, well-conducted studies are needed to clarify the effect of soy dose on lipid parameters and to determine whether soy components other than protein or isoflavones may be responsible for the lipid effects seen.  
> - [Effects of Soy on Health Outcomes - Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality - 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20170201070904/https://archive.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/soyeffects/soy.pdf)

This incredibly in-depth metanalaysis found insufficient evidence for any detrimental health claims, though this was often due to poor study quality (sample sizes, methdology, etc.) discounting the results.

#### Vegan Society & British Association of Dietitians

> Evidence suggests that soya is not a threat to our health and is in fact a reliable and healthy protein source.  
> - [Vegan Society - General FAQs](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002203547/https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/general-faqs)

TalkVeganToMe reached out to The Vegan Society to enquire after the sources for the evidence. The Vegan Society replied incredibly promptly and directed us to the The British Association of Dietitian's as their source.

> There is now scientific agreement that the controversy around isoflavones’ potential to have bad side effects in humans is fuelled only by findings from laboratory or animal studies using pure isoflavones or high doses. It is well established that animals metabolise isoflavones in a different and much more efficient way to humans and results from such studies cannot be compared to any human outcomes. Additionally, using high doses of pure isoflavones cannot be compared to consuming isoflavones from whole soya foods as they provide lower quantities and are a combination of many biologically active molecules. Comprehensive reviews by the European Food Safety Authority, World Cancer Research Fund and the World Health Organisation all conclude that soya foods as part of a healthy balanced diet are safe.
