# Popular Fact

> Soy has estrogen and the consumption of soy products (e.g. soy milk, tofu, etc.) can have numerous effects on the body from gynecomastia, reduced fertility, increased risk of Hypothyroidism, and increased cancer risk, to helping reduce symptoms of menopause

# Reality

> Soy contains phytoestrogens which are structurally similar to human estrogen, these are also known as *isoflavones*.  
> While there are a number of sources which assure us of the safety of soy, there are conflicts of interest/a lack of primary sources in all those we have found so far.  
> There are also methodological concerns with the articles that proclaim the contrary.  
> The vast majority of articles published seem to say "More research is needed".  
> At the moment, the question of "Is soy healthy?" appears unanswered.

There is an *huge* amount of information available on the topic (more than 2000 soy-related peer-reviewed articles are published annually ([Soy and Health Update - Nutrients 2016](http://web.archive.org/web/20190923193109/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5188409/))).  
As yet, we have not found what we consider a reliable source condoning the safety of soy consumption.  
The closest we have are the British Dietetics Association and NHS recommendations, which both lack significant evidence from primary sources. See below for more on these.  
The only other sources we've found for a blanket assertion that say soy is safe come from one of the articles authored by Mark Messina, see below for why we have excluded those.

This is *not* the same as a conclusion that soy is bad for you, as there are a number of methodological concerns with the studies that support negative effects from consuming soy.


## The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens 

## Mark Messina

Many of the pro-soy articles we've found have Mark Messina listed as an author. 
As declared on [one of zirs articles]((https://web.archive.org/web/20190923193109/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5188409/)), Mark Messina is "The executive director of the Soy Nutrition Institute, an organization funded by the United Soybean Board and its soy industry members".

We don't mean to suggest any impropriety on Dr Messina's part but when citing articles we want to avoid the merest suggestion of bias as it may undermine your ability as a reader to confidently cite your sources.

As a result, when researching this article, we excluded the following articles from our search:

## British Association of Dietitians

> There is now scientific agreement that the controversy around isoflavones’ potential to have bad side effects in humans is fuelled only by findings from laboratory or animal studies using pure isoflavones or high doses. It is well established that animals metabolise isoflavones in a different and much more efficient way to humans and results from such studies cannot be compared to any human outcomes. Additionally, using high doses of pure isoflavones cannot be compared to consuming isoflavones from whole soya foods as they provide lower quantities and are a combination of many biologically active molecules. Comprehensive reviews by the European Food Safety Authority, World Cancer Research Fund and the World Health Organisation all conclude that soya foods as part of a healthy balanced diet are safe.

The [additional fact sheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928101207/https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/food_fact_sheet_information_sources/soya2017infosources) includes

* One article from the WHO called "[Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Human Nutrition](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928095834/https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf?ua=1)" which doesn't seem to make a healthfulness claim for soy except as a source of protein.
* One article from the World Cancer Research Fund titled "[Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective](https://web.archive.org/web/20160716163208/http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/4841/1/4841.pdf)" that talks a lot about the potential cancer-curing effects of isoflavones but does not appear to talk about the risks or evidence of a lack thereof.
* No articles from the EFSA. The EFSA has published two articles pertaining to the safety of soy, one studying [peri and post menopausal women](http://web.archive.org/web/20190928155801/https://dyz6l42c0kkca.cloudfront.net/articles/downloaded/wiley/1f92a95cd5b6df28fc372d2e27d9a41e23263ee9140a6051246fec4015b2d8d5.pdf?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3D%22%28ANS%29-2015-EFSA_Journal.pdf%22&Expires=1569801600&Signature=ebEOZ47SMQnacLWjKUWeIBRuzmmi6xmSFu7Dx2OqPV5S1dWO9UjM5Ac1Q5dvOYa3tx8fLs5lrgS2HChGWDgVdnMA0xaJwe~z6WhaMNTIwGiwhNI2R08iT0AscmeshgHegohglT1EXUVYzejfOM9lWMWPM2Fau~n9fBB8vxYhAOU_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAI2AQJBOTGLBL6N3A), and another pertaining to soy's [potential positive effect on cardiovascular health by way of cholesterol](http://web.archive.org/web/20190928155912/https://dyz6l42c0kkca.cloudfront.net/articles/downloaded/wiley/2c63f5b65d7abd7418a3603b4ae0659cd09a499d69897753f36b2bcf65a5fc3f.pdf?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3D%22%28NDA%29-2011-EFSA_Journal.pdf%22&Expires=1569801600&Signature=MqiOMdJ7zFf-MIr91LNxxY6b5RjXaKCTQQ0OGOOUxRxHYoE4SIGPSXlzUmwOXb8JO9svBHim5PyEegiElR5ZCrnUY4gs1DXmzZokYUOWbiQQucqd8Q~Ed7NNxZqUu6s3CyNb1cyRgIOLhOZhLwi2rIarwmoeBEeG~0kGF9eoWv0_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAI2AQJBOTGLBL6N3A).

As none of these really qualify as comprehensive reviews concluding that soya foods are safe as part of a healthy balanced diet as suggested by the BDA, we are (rather shockingly) having to discount their assertion on this topic due to a lack of primary sources.
