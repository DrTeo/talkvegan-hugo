# Popular Fact

> Soy's phytoestrogens cause a variety of negative health effects including reducing male fertility.

See our article: [Soy contains estrogen]({{<ref "/facts/soy-contains-estrogen">}}) for more information on phytoestrogens.

# Reality

> Soy contains phytoestrogens which are structurally similar to human estrogen (specifically *isoflavones*) which may have negative effects in high enough dosages.  
> It is _unlikely_ that you will ingest a high enough dosage to affect your health as part of a balanced diet provided you do not have any special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.).  
> All articles on the topic caveat their conclusions with: More research is needed.  
> Ensure that you vary your protein sources and consult your dietitian for special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.)

There is an *huge* amount of information available on the topic (more than 2000 soy-related peer-reviewed articles are published annually ([Soy and Health Update - Nutrients 2016](http://web.archive.org/web/20190923193109/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5188409/))). 
Those which point to negative health effects of soy usually have extremely small sample sizes and extremely high dosages.   
Those which suggest that there is no evidence of negative outcomes caveat these conclusions with the claims that there is a lack of

## Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018

> Inter-individual variation of isoflavone activation capacity (mainly located in to the microbiota), differences in cultivar, environmental factor, culture methods, storage, food processing and other confounders (i.e., other dietary habits), pose challenges to forecast the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of phytoestrogens. It should be noted that the composition of soy food may differ substantially from unprocessed soy beans. More data on safety are needed but soy foods seems to have a favourable effect on women health, in particular if gut daidzein to equol conversion readily occurs. Soy food can be safe and even beneficial if consumed by women with breast cancer diagnosis. Among soy products there are remarkable differences in nutrients and phytochemicals composition that need careful interpretation of data on soy effect from different soy foods.
> Overall, the low content of bioactive compounds in second generation soy foods and moderate amounts in traditional soy preparations offer modest health benefits with very limited risk for potential adverse health effects. At the same time, to have the beneficial effects of soy isoflavones, intake should be at least of 60–100 mg per day, at present not easily reached in Western countries.

This article is a reasonable summary of previous articles but falls short of evaluating them critically.

## The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017

> [P]hytoestrogens are also considered endocrine disruptors, indicating that they have the potential to cause adverse health effects such as infertility and increased risks of cancer in oestrogen‐sensitive organs. These adverse effects have been mainly suggested based on data from in vitro, animal or epidemiological studies. Clinical studies often report the absence of adverse effects. 
> Tempfer et al. (2009) reported a meta‐analysis on possible side effects of phytoestrogens. Based on 174 randomized controlled trials, it was concluded that phytoestrogen supplements have a safe side effect profile with moderately elevated rates of gastrointestinal side effects. It is important to note, however, that these studies were generally not designed to study the safety of the phytoestrogens.  
> [...]  
> [I]t can be concluded that several potential health benefits of phytoestrogens have been reported but that, given the data on potential adverse health effects, the current evidence on these beneficial health effects is not so obvious that they clearly outweigh the possible health risks. This implies that a definite conclusion on possible beneficial health effects of phytoestrogens cannot be made.

This study does not put a specific weight to the risks in question, focussing more heavily as it does on the research into the potential benefits. It simply acknowledges that because "the health benefits or risks of isoflavones and other phytoestrogens are still controversial" making recommendations to consume additional soy products on the basis of the supposed benefits is not warranted.

## Pros and cons of phytoestrogens - Front Neuroendocrinol - 2010

> Infants fed soy formula have the highest exposure to any nonpharmacological source of estrogen-like compounds, yet we know virtually nothing about how the use of these phytoestrogen-rich formulas might impact their future reproductive health.  
> [...]   
> Consumers should be aware that soy contains endocrine disrupting compounds and make dietary choices accordingly. For a typical consumer, alarm over soy products is likely unnecessary but so is the belief that a soy-rich diet will alleviate all ills. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or attempting to become pregnant should use soy foods with caution and be aware that soy formula may not be the best option for their babies. Older individuals, especially those with high cholesterol, may experience modest benefits including improved bone and cardiovascular health, and perhaps a decreased risk of carcinogenesis.

## Effect of soy on health outcomes - Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality - 2005

>  The evidence from human studies does not suggest any worrisome adverse events beyond mild gastrointestinal intolerance. Conclusions were often limited due to small numbers of studies or heterogeneity across studies. Given the large amount of heterogeneity and inadequate reporting, particularly related to soy protein and isoflavone dose, many questions remain as to whether specific soy products in adequate doses may be of benefit in specific populations. Further, well-conducted studies are needed to clarify the effect of soy dose on lipid parameters and to determine whether soy components other than protein or isoflavones may be responsible for the lipid effects seen.

This incredibly in-depth metanalaysis found insufficient evidence for any detrimental health claims, though this was often due to poor study quality (sample sizes, methdology, etc.) discounting the results.

## Mark Messina

Many of the pro-soy articles we've found have Mark Messina listed as an author. 
As declared on [one of zirs articles]((https://web.archive.org/web/20190923193109/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5188409/)), Mark Messina is "The executive director of the Soy Nutrition Institute, an organization funded by the United Soybean Board and its soy industry members".

We don't mean to suggest any impropriety on Dr Messina's part but when citing articles we want to avoid the merest suggestion of bias as it may undermine your ability as a reader to confidently cite your sources.

As a result, when researching this article, we excluded the following articles from our investigation:

## British Association of Dietitians

> There is now scientific agreement that the controversy around isoflavones’ potential to have bad side effects in humans is fuelled only by findings from laboratory or animal studies using pure isoflavones or high doses. It is well established that animals metabolise isoflavones in a different and much more efficient way to humans and results from such studies cannot be compared to any human outcomes. Additionally, using high doses of pure isoflavones cannot be compared to consuming isoflavones from whole soya foods as they provide lower quantities and are a combination of many biologically active molecules. Comprehensive reviews by the European Food Safety Authority, World Cancer Research Fund and the World Health Organisation all conclude that soya foods as part of a healthy balanced diet are safe.

The [additional fact sheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928101207/https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/food_fact_sheet_information_sources/soya2017infosources) includes

* One article from the World Cancer Research Fund titled "[Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective](https://web.archive.org/web/20160716163208/http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/4841/1/4841.pdf)" that talks a lot about the potential cancer-curing effects of isoflavones but does not appear to talk about the risks or evidence of a lack thereof.
* No articles from the EFSA. The EFSA has published two articles pertaining to the safety of soy, one studying [peri and post menopausal women](http://web.archive.org/web/20190928155801/https://dyz6l42c0kkca.cloudfront.net/articles/downloaded/wiley/1f92a95cd5b6df28fc372d2e27d9a41e23263ee9140a6051246fec4015b2d8d5.pdf?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3D%22%28ANS%29-2015-EFSA_Journal.pdf%22&Expires=1569801600&Signature=ebEOZ47SMQnacLWjKUWeIBRuzmmi6xmSFu7Dx2OqPV5S1dWO9UjM5Ac1Q5dvOYa3tx8fLs5lrgS2HChGWDgVdnMA0xaJwe~z6WhaMNTIwGiwhNI2R08iT0AscmeshgHegohglT1EXUVYzejfOM9lWMWPM2Fau~n9fBB8vxYhAOU_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAI2AQJBOTGLBL6N3A), and another pertaining to soy's [potential positive effect on cardiovascular health by way of cholesterol](http://web.archive.org/web/20190928155912/https://dyz6l42c0kkca.cloudfront.net/articles/downloaded/wiley/2c63f5b65d7abd7418a3603b4ae0659cd09a499d69897753f36b2bcf65a5fc3f.pdf?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3D%22%28NDA%29-2011-EFSA_Journal.pdf%22&Expires=1569801600&Signature=MqiOMdJ7zFf-MIr91LNxxY6b5RjXaKCTQQ0OGOOUxRxHYoE4SIGPSXlzUmwOXb8JO9svBHim5PyEegiElR5ZCrnUY4gs1DXmzZokYUOWbiQQucqd8Q~Ed7NNxZqUu6s3CyNb1cyRgIOLhOZhLwi2rIarwmoeBEeG~0kGF9eoWv0_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAI2AQJBOTGLBL6N3A).

As none of these really qualify as comprehensive reviews concluding that soya foods are safe as part of a healthy balanced diet as suggested by the BDA, we are (rather shockingly) having to discount their assertion on this topic due to a lack of primary sources.
