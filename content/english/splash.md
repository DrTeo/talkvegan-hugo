# Welcome to TalkVeganToMe

TalkVeganToMe is a pro-intersectional, compassionate, collaborative project intended to provide vegans old and new alike a central resource for commonly required information about veganism.  

This app is intended to act as a repository of quick access information for vegans to handle everyday situations.
