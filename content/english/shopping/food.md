# Food

When you first start checking labels on products in the supermarket it can seem overwhelming to check for everything, especially when it comes to E numbers and obscure ingredients. Do the best you can, but try not to overwhelm yourself.

## Vegetarian Products

It's easy to be lulled into a false sense of security by products made from vegetarian manufacturers like Quorn. But keep a watchful eye on the ingredients of these products as they commonly contain non-vegan ingredients even when you least expect!

## Gotchas

- Honey
- Beer/Wine
- Bread (Regional. particularly in the UK often contains milk)
- Smoothies (Often contain yogurt)
- Chocolate (Dark chocolate is usually fine, but always check the packaging for milk!)

## Resources

- Beer [Barnivore](http://www.barnivore.com/) is a great source of information
