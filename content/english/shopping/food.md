# Food and Drink

When you first start checking labels on products in the supermarket it can seem overwhelming to check for everything, especially when it comes to E numbers and obscure ingredients. Do the best you can, but remember that mistakes do happen, just treat them as learning experiences.

## Gotchas

It's amazing what can contain animal products, here are a few of the things that surprise new vegans and can catch them out.

- Honey (It is an animal product)
- [E-numbers]({{ ref: "shopping/e-numbers"}}) (Animal products hide behind some e numbers)
- Beer/Wine (Fish swim bladders are often used in the filtering process)
- Bread (Regional. particularly in the UK often contains milk)
- Smoothies (Often contain yogurt)
- Chocolate (Dark chocolate is usually fine, but always check the packaging for milk)


## E-numbers

See the [E-Numbers]({{ ref: "shopping/e-numbers"}}) section for more!

## Vegetarian Products

It's easy to be lulled into a false sense of security by products made from vegetarian manufacturers like Quorn. But keep a watchful eye on the ingredients of these products as they commonly contain non-vegan ingredients even when you least expect!
