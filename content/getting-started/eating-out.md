# Eating Out

The ease of eating out varies hugely depending on where you are in the world, and also who you're with.  

## Scenarios

### Attending a function you didn't organise

If you're going a restaurant, find the menu online, and email the restaurant in advance with any questions you have. A little preparation can go a long way to making the process smoother.

If you're attending a catered function, contact the organiser if possible specifying No Meat, No Dairy, No Eggs, No Honey, do not rely on people knowing what 'vegan' means, even if they claim to!
